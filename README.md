# mlpack-bot

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot), for the
mlpack organization.  Helpful and friendly mlpack bot!

This implementation is largely based on the existing work of other Probot
modules and uses their code extensively:

 - [first-pr-merge](https://github.com/behaviorbot/first-pr-merge)
 - [triage-new-issues](https://github.com/tunnckoCoreLabs/triage-new-issues)
 - [new-pr-welcome](https://github.com/behaviorbot/new-pr-welcome)
 - [stale](https://github.com/probot/stale)
 - [new-issue-welcome](https://github.com/behaviorbot/new-issue-welcome)

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```
